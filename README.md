# A Theory on the Effect of Gangstalking

When gangstalking is legal and prevalent, mass shootings happen more. This has to do with 
the agitation and paranoia that gangstalking promotes in targeted individuals. Someone in 
the mix becomes so infuriated that they take it upon themselves to conduct a mass shooting. 

The odds of a mass shooting occurring is compounded when the perpetrator has felt a strong 
sense of being bullied in some way, shape, or form. Bullying is a possibility in cases of 
gangstalking. The factor of the quality of the perpetrator's support system (social, financial, 
et cetera) is also of relevance in the events that ensued. In short, gangstalking is a contributor 
to further anti-social behavior, and the behavior may be evidently harmful from the perspective 
of the perpetrator when they consider aspects such as their finance and social life, both of 
which are poor in quantity and lacking in quality. 

Gangstalking is argued to be a remedy for social ills. From news reports, the USA was or is 
in the midst of a mental health crisis. An environment filled with suspicion and ad hominem 
develops. A hypothesis is that gangstalking is intended to promote greater community, for there 
are more people in a space that are in direct or indirect interaction with one another. But 
gangstalking does not since it is seldom welcome, seldom solicited by those that are stalked. 
An issue in dealing with gangstalking is that laws concerning freedoms enable this kind of behavior. 
For example, paparazzi is not usually unlawful except in the extreme cases of intrusion. Gangstalking 
is related to vigilante activity and populist movements, both of which are started and propagated 
due to perceived failures in official institutions, failures that some argue produce social ills 
or encourage those ills to metastasize into greater problems.
