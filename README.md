# A Theory on the Effect of Gangstalking

When gangstalking is legal and prevalent, mass shootings happen more. This has to do with 
the agitation and paranoia that gangstalking promotes in targeted individuals. Someone in 
the mix becomes so infuriated that they take it upon themselves to conduct a mass shooting. 

The odds of a mass shooting occurring is compounded when the perpetrator has felt a strong 
sense of being bullied in some way, shape, or form. Bullying is a possibility in cases of 
gangstalking. The factor of the quality of the perpetrator's support system (social, financial, 
et cetera) is also of relevance in the events that ensued. In short, gangstalking is a contributor 
to further anti-social behavior, and the behavior may be evidently harmful from the perspective 
of the perpetrator when they consider aspects such as their finance and social life, both of 
which are poor in quantity and lacking in quality. 

Gangstalking is argued to be a remedy for social ills. From news reports, the USA was or is 
in the midst of a mental health crisis. An environment filled with suspicion and ad hominem 
develops. A hypothesis is that gangstalking is intended to promote greater community, for there 
are more people in a space that are in direct or indirect interaction with one another. But 
gangstalking does not since it is seldom welcome, seldom solicited by those that are stalked. 
An issue in dealing with gangstalking is that laws concerning freedoms enable this kind of behavior. 
For example, paparazzi is not usually unlawful except in the extreme cases of intrusion. Gangstalking 
is related to vigilante activity and populist movements, both of which are started and propagated 
due to perceived failures in official institutions, failures that some argue produce social ills 
or encourage those ills to metastasize into greater problems. 

Gangstalking has other correlations such as to late-stage capitalism and big security business. 
Both of these concepts need to be elaborated on for their correlations to gangstalking to be 
made obvious. Late-stage capitalism occurs when the population of a territory, typically that of 
a nation-state, fails to derive profit, distributed in ways that effectively serve the population, 
from certain products. These products may be sophisticated to create, requiring skills that take 
years for an individual to develop proficiency in. And the pyramidal work force experiences a 
"spiritual decline", per se, in their work ethic and values from the fruits of their labor. Collective 
confusion over values that cannot be quantified in terms of currency and the perceived inequality in the 
distribution of currency lend way for some people to be persuaded that there is an economic decline 
that they are a part of, yet no longer want to participate in due to their acknowledgment of the 
economic decline. The most developed and most under-developed parts of the workforce are either put 
out of work or experience workplace hardships during late-stage capitalism. These members then turn 
towards social activity that may involve gangstalking, especially in campaigns that deal with the 
concepts of "social credit" and identity politics. As with most questionable activity, financial 
incentives cannot be immediately ruled out, especially in territories with sophisticated banking 
protections. 

On the matter of big security, gangstalking certainly appears compatible with the security agenda 
of perfect information and appropriate response. And because of this perceived compatibility, proponents 
of gangstalking surely will argue that gangstalking decreases the rate of mass shootings. They will state 
that there are more participants in the agenda of protecting the "public peace", something along the lines 
of that, so that if there is a potential mass shooting, the perpetrator will be disarmed before getting to 
any violent results. However, this is questionable due to the reactionary antagonism that gangstalking may 
elicit from the targeted individual. The doubts are readily understandable in cases where the gangstalkers 
make their presence obvious in ways that are either intimidating by posturing or disingenuine through scripted 
acts and imitation. One quality of gangstalking that decreases the effectiveness of the numbers involved is 
the trickle-down effect of privatized information. With privatized information, there is less direct access 
to said information. The few that have direct access to said information may take the liberty to play the 
"game of telephone" with participant members. A popular experiment on the "game of telephone" demonstrated 
the lack of empirical likeness from one end of the messaging line to the other in a long line of lines. The 
mobocratic command structure behind gangstalking is more blunt than sharp, so a convincing conclusion on the 
motive for such activity is for political fronting, instead of serving as a precise fix for the issues that 
the targeted individual of the activity is a part of. 

<ul>The concept of gangstalking has been allocated to the realm of fringe theory, for the most part.</ul> This 
is only natural due to the offensive imagery of numerable people organized in some way to conduct stalking on a few 
individuals; some matters are better not mentioned, goes the wisdom. As such, proving such activity is difficult 
due to the nature of cross-referencing and opposing agenda that is not conducive for collaboration. Participants 
of gangstalking may also argue that they, themselves, are the ones that are being "stalked" by their fellow 
participants in the activity, due to the constant exchanges during coordination, thus blurring the lines between 
offendor and defender.
