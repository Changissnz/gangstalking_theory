# A Theory on the Effect of Gangstalking

When gangstalking is legal and prevalent, mass shootings happen more. This has to do with 
the agitation and paranoia that gangstalking promotes in targeted individuals. Someone in 
the mix becomes so infuriated that they take it upon themselves to conduct a mass shooting. 

The odds of a mass shooting occurring is compounded when the perpetrator has felt a strong 
sense of being bullied in some way, shape, or form. Bullying is a possibility in cases of 
gangstalking. The factor of the quality of the perpetrator's support system (social, financial, 
et cetera) is also of relevance in the events that ensued. In short, gangstalking is a contributor 
to further anti-social behavior, and the behavior may be evidently harmful from the perspective 
of the perpetrator when they consider aspects such as their finance and social life, both of 
which are poor in quantity and lacking in quality.
